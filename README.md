# My personal website

This is my own website running at https://bernhard.gschwantner.org. It's built as a static site using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). It is based on [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

## 🚀 How to start

```sh
# install the dependencies
npm install
# start the dev server
npm run develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

\_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_
